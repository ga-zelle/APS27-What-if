===========
Major addition
 - GUI front end to collect inputs and guide users who are less IT literate
 - STAIR to define basal like time dependent variations
 - INTERPOL to define inter- and extrapolation in time dependent variations
Minor addition
 - logfiles may also be left in original zip format
Removed bugs
 - one error in determine_basal.py
 - one reporting error in assigning the variations


22.April 2020
=============
Extended the selection of logfiles to define the evaluation time window by
 - using wildcard characters "*" and "?" to match several logfiles like AndroidAPS._2020-04-02* for a whole day
 - define a start time for the emulation in UTC format like "2020-04-02T10:00:00Z" for noon MESZ time zone
 - define an end time for the emulation in UTC firmat like "2020-04-02T12", i.e. ending at 14:00 in MESZ time zone
Added more values to list or plot, namely
 - IOB, COB, autosense ratio, insulin activity
Added graphic output for
 - predictions as shown on the AAPS home screen
 - flowchart of how the decisons in determine-basal are transversed at each time step
Debugged one error in determine_basal.py
