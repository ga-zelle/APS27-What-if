18.Nov.2020
===========
Adapted for AAPS version 2.7, still compatible with versions 2.5 and 2.6
Major addition
 - support autoISF for BG being consistantly too high or too low or rising for a longer time
 - version selection "2.7" or "<2.7" as a what-if scenario
 - can run on AAPS phone, too,  to give real time what-if hints
 - on AAPS phone provide spoken alarms for "add'l carbs req" or "extra bolus proposed" from what-if alternative
Added more values to list or plot, namely
 - ISF
 - range for BG being unchanged
 - linear regression of recent BG
 - several min and max values for time window in tab-file, e.g. for autosense or SMB
Limitation
 - the flowchart output for version 2.7 uses outdated row number references


31.May 2020
===========
Major addition
 - added GUI front end to collect inputs and guide users who are less IT literate
 - STAIR to define basal like time dependent variations
 - INTERPOL to define inter- and extrapolation in time dependent variations
Minor addition
 - logfiles may also be left in original zip format
Removed bugs
 - one error in determine_basal.py
 - one reporting error in assigning the variations


22.April 2020
=============
Extended the selection of logfiles to define the evaluation time window by
 - using wildcard characters "*" and "?" to match several logfiles like AndroidAPS._2020-04-02* for a whole day
 - define a start time for the emulation in UTC format like "2020-04-02T10:00:00Z" for noon MESZ time zone
 - define an end time for the emulation in UTC firmat like "2020-04-02T12", i.e. ending at 14:00 in MESZ time zone
Added more values to list or plot, namely
 - IOB, COB, autosense ratio, insulin activity
Added graphic output for
 - predictions as shown on the AAPS home screen
 - flowchart of how the decisons in determine-basal are transversed at each time step
Debugged one error in determine_basal.py

=============
Adapted for AAPS verison 2.6.1

Changes Related to variant definition improve checking the success of variant definition process:
 - debugged reporting of new, additional parameters
 - added reporting of ignored instructions
